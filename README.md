## Crowd Activity Dataset

### Introduction
This dataset concentrates on the activities of the crowd for a fine-grained image classification task, named as Crowd Activity dataset, as automatically understanding crowd activity is meaningful for social security. This dataset is newly collected, where the images are mainly searched on the Internet and collected from streets by mobile phones. All images in this dataset contain at least one text instance. The categories come from activities of daily living and demonstrations stimulated by hot events in recent years. Specifically, this dataset consists of 21 categories and 8785 images in total. The 21 categories broadly fall into two types: activities of daily living(i.e., celebrating Christmas, holding sport meeting, holding concert, celebrating birthday party, celebrity speech, teaching, graduation ceremony, picnic, press briefing, shopping, celebrating Thanks giving day) and demonstrations (i.e., protecting animals, protecting environment, appealing for peace, Brexit, COVID-19, election, immigrant, respecting female, racial equality, mouvement des gilets jaunes).
